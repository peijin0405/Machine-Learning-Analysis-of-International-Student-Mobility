## Machine Learning Analysis of International Student Mobility: A Case Study of China
This research project is designed to examine the determinants influencing the mobility of international students, with a specific focus on students from Belt and Road Initiative (B&R) countries studying in China. The objective is to analyze trends in the mobility of international students in China over the past two decades, identify the influencing factors, and forecast future trends.

#### Theoretical Framework: Push-Pull Theory
The study is grounded in the Push-Pull theory, a fundamental framework that elucidates the dynamics of population migration. Ernst G. Ravenstein, in his seminal work "The Law of Migration," articulated that migration factors are dichotomously categorized as "push" factors, which are the repulsive forces in the origin country, and "pull" factors, which are the attractive forces in the destination country. These factors collectively facilitate and drive population movements. This research will employ the Push-Pull theory to categorize and analyze the determinants affecting international student mobility.

#### Methodology and Data Collection
The research will identify push factors including the gross tertiary enrollment ratio, tertiary student-teacher ratio, the ratio of per capita financial expenditure on higher education to per capita GDP, educational inequality, GDP per capita, and the density of R&D researchers. Pull factors will encompass opportunities for scholarships, degree recognition between countries, bilateral trade volume, with geographical distance and the number of outbound students from the origin country serving as control variables.

Data on the number of international students in China and scholarship opportunities will be extracted from the Concise Statistics of International Students Coming to China. Additional data, such as gross tertiary enrollment ratios, student-teacher ratios, and outbound student numbers, will be sourced from the UNESCO database. GDP per capita and R&D researcher metrics will be retrieved from the World Bank, while trade volumes and geographical distances will be obtained from UN Comtrade and the CEPII Database, respectively.

This study will also incorporate web scraping techniques to gather data on the list of Belt and Road countries and the mutual recognition of degrees. Data wrangling methods will be employed to manage and analyze the data, and predictive modeling will be utilized to forecast trends in international student mobility in China.
